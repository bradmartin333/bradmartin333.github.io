	  <h2>Actually Understanding OpenTK</h2>
	  <h5>Feb 20, 2020</h5>
	  <p>
	  It is easy to copy a tutorial and feel satisfied.
      I had to follow at least 5 tutorials until I was able to do it on my own.
      Maybe I should have just read the book like they all did while making the tutorials.
      Oh well, I have moving rectangles! And I did it myself!
      I don't need a Z dimension for this project, so making rectangles saves precious RAM.

	  <h5>Feb 18, 2020</h5>
	  <p>
	  If you are savvy with Python Pandas or know what a for loop is,
      then rotating and flipping arrays is small potatoes.
      But, if your data never sees the world outside the cells of a
      Excel file, you might need a VBA extension... or the carnival-esque

	  <h2>Entroptik v2.0 and OpenGL</h2>
	  <h5>Feb 17, 2020</h5>
	  <p>
	  I completed <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Entroptik">Entroptik v2.0</a> and it works the same way,
      but teaching the feature locations has changed.
      I have also started using OpenTK for visualizations. Very cool!
      Big thanks to <a href="http://dreamstatecoding.blogspot.com/p/opengl4-with-opentk-tutorials.html">Dreamstate Coding</a>
      for the tutorials.

	  <h2>Entroptik</h2>
	  <h5>Jan 19, 2020</h5>
	  <p>
	  Finished up a redo of an old project.
      I am not too fond of the name, but it works as designed.
      Everything is availble in the GitHub repo.
      You take a folder of images and parse them into an output log that tells you if certain
      features were present or absent.
      It is designed of quality control type work with AOI type machines.
      The advantage here is that the program is "dumb" and this runs very fast
      and doesn't need any licenses because it uses literally only one call to MathNet.Numerics.
      Enjoy!

	  <h2>New Desktop</h2>
	  <h5>Jan 4, 2020</h5>
	  <p>
	  Just set up a new desktop for work/home use.
      Best way to install Lua on Win10 is described
      <a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/BuildingLuaInWindowsForNewbies">here.</a>
      Then, install the LuaScript plugin to Notepad++ and add a hotkey to run current script.
      Also, compiling with love2d is a lot easier than I thought if the Win10 version of love2d is installed.
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/bradmartin333/1c47055767f4cd0641e0db9feecb42ba.js"></script>
      Just have to swap file name if desired.
      Yes, I have also ventured into powershell scripting and autohotkey.
      In other words, I have not enabled WSL on this new computer and I am getting more done!

	  <h2>LÖVE Clicky</h2>
	  <h5>Dec 31, 2020</h5>
	  <p>
	  I have ventured into the space of Lua and LÖVE.
	  It is an amazing resource for creating 2D games.
	  I think it will be useful for work and personal projects.
	  To start, I recreated my JS Clicky.
	  It is a lot more intuitive and the community is marvelous.
	  <a href="https://github.com/love2d-community/awesome-love2d">This page</a>
	  shows some of the phenomenal work done and
	  you can package everything into HTML and/or JS with
	  <a href="https://schellingb.github.io/LoveWebBuilder/">this insanely cool tool.</a>
	  I refuse to get involved with Docker at this point in my life, so thank you Bernhard Schelling.
	  <a href="https://www.one-tab.com/page/monw97dnTcuGuWHouP0NNQ">Here is a small list</a> 
	  of very cool libraries that will make it much easier to take things to the next level.
	  Distibuting to all platforms is very easy and having a small .exe in the end
	  is always my goal. Here, all the game files are in a directory that is zipped into
	  a .love (Just a renamed .zip) file. Run it through love.exe and you have the distributable .exe!
	  <script src="https://gist.github.com/bradmartin333/6cf87b05c16ad133eefb399a56bd4feb.js"></script>
	  Someone made a C# solution of the same name that does this upon file change...
	  so I might switch to that method.
	  I always try to use the best language for the job at hand, and this is without
	  a doubt the best way to make lightweight 2D GUI that relies on mouse input events.
	  Now, what is this about Moonscript??

	  This was a huge learning experience.
	  Thanks to Rembound and Kirupa for their tutorials.
	  Overall, I find this frontend stuff pretty nasty...
	  but, it is very useful and easy to deploy projects and ideas.
	  So, I will stick with it and continue to find out how to make
	  HTML CSS and JS play nicely together.

Just finished my first big solo project at XDC.
10 vacuum hoses needed to be controlled via a GUI
that would also monitor the 10 vacuum sensors.
The hardest part was fitting everything into
the limited space beneath the motion stage.
The 10 SMC valves and sensors as well as all the hoses
and wires to link everything together is seen below.

The DB25 ribbon cable had to be ripped in half to fit
through the existing cable track.
The crimping connectors from Winford Engineering
made that part possible, as I could not take the
chuck off to install a normal DB25 cable.
This is the only cable running to the brains in the
back of the machine. Here, the Winford breakout board
allows for easy wiring to the Acromag Ethernet I/O units 
and Phoenixpower distribution blocks.

The GUI exists in a standalone executable and, in the
interest of company privacy, the only intersting part I
will share is the read/write functions with the Acromag
units. The units share an array of four 16 bit integers
that describe the status of their registers.
Using a class for each vacuum zone, I could write all valve
outputs on a user button press and read all sensors
on a timer interval.
